# TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password

Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a critical component of modern two-factor authentication systems. It provides an additional layer of security by generating temporary, time-sensitive codes.

## How TOTP Works

TOTP generates a unique 6-digit code every 30 seconds based on:
- Current time
- Shared secret key
- HMAC-SHA1 algorithm

## Advantages

- **Offline Generation**: No internet connection required
- **Enhanced Security**: Codes expire quickly
- **Wide Support**: Compatible with most authenticator apps

## Security Considerations

- **Time Synchronization**: Devices must have accurate time
- **Key Storage**: Secret keys must be stored securely
- **Backup Codes**: Always have backup authentication methods

TOTP remains one of the most reliable forms of two-factor authentication available today.
